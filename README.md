# Meteor-Hunt
Little game project based on Asteroids from Atari.

We used pygame library to develop


## How to play
Download the repository and execute the "Meteor Hunt.exe"

Navigate through the menu with the arrow keys, choose with Enter

As the game is in Portuguese, here are the translation of the screens:

The first menu option will start the game, then choose the desired controller scheme with the lateral arrows:
- Left: move the space ship with the arrow keys and shoot by holding space
- Right: move the space ship with the mouse movement and shoot by holding the left click button
  
In both options "P" will pause/unpause the game, "Esc" will pause on the first time and close the game on the second

You have 4 lives (label on top-right corner)

At the end of the game you'll be prompted with a text input to enter your name for register your score, press enter to confirm and return to the main menu

The second menu option is the highscore list, composed by [Position][Name][Score]
- The first option will reset the score, then confirm the action by selecting the first ("sim") option on the next screen, cancel with the second ("n√£o")
- The second option will return to the main menu

The third menu option is the game options menu
- First option activate/deactivate all sound (with lateral arrows)
- Second option increase/decrease volume (with lateral arrows)
- Third option will return to the main menu

The fourth option will close the game, as well as the "Esc" key

That's it, have fun!
